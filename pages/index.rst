   The PlanetaryPy Project is a community effort to develop a core
   package for planetary science in Python and foster interoperability
   between Python planetary science packages.

If you're a Python user, we have a listing of PlanetaryPy `Affiliated
Packages <packages/>`_ that show good coding practices
and good community practices.  We're also working on developing a
core `planetarypy` library.  The `OpenPlanetary
<https://www.openplanetary.org/>`_ python Slack channel is a great place
to engage with a community of other planetary Python users.

If you're a Python developer looking for ways to contribute to the
planetary sciences, please consider investigating our `Affiliated
Packages <packages/>`_, and working on their Issues,
you'll find all of them welcoming of new contributions.

If you're a Python developer with an existing package that you think
others would benefit from, whether you've already released it or not,
please consider `applying <link://slug/review-process>`_ to be an Affiliated Package.

If you're new to open source collaboration on GitHub, we recommend the "How to 
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub" `video guide 
<https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github>`_
(~40 mins) or practice your first pull request on the `plutopy 
<https://github.com/cjtu/plutopy>`_ repository (~10 mins).

For more information about the PlanetaryPy Project, Michael Aye gave a 
`talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwvRkXpmCXc>`_ and the `slides
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H-tGxfkSHF8vS-_rt5DQHVFmBYkJNaJW6yElUe9s2Ok/edit?usp=sharing>`_
are available.
